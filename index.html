					<div class="text">
					<p>Tuesday is pizzatime! Thanks to Pizza Hut you can eat pizza for the only 5,95 euros. What does this mean if you’re part of the Noticed team? Your stomach has to be pizzaproof. This can also occur on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. So basically it can happen you’re eating pizza the whole week. Be aware of the risk for a few extra pounds! </p>

					<p>This is not only important because dead cactuses are ugly, it is also part of the Noticed culture. Every colleague has his/ her own cactus and has to take care of it. This doesn’t mean it looks like a dessert here; we are talking about mini cactuses, positioned nicely next to everyone’s computer. The person whose cactus dies first has to treat the others! Probably nobody cares whether this is beer, cake or cookies.</p>

						<p>Be aware of your side job as a kitchen manager
						Working at Noticed means having two jobs at the same time. No, we are not talking about two full time jobs. It is only for five days every six weeks. That days you are responsible for the trash and the dishes- and yes we have a dishwasher. All in all, there are worse side jobs!

							No, we aren’t talking about real monkeys or your colleagues! We have mailchimps everywhere and as an agency we are trying to collect as many as possible. When the possibility to order them occurs- whether it is 11 PM or 3 AM- everyone has to do the very best they can and make good use of having multiple addresses (office and home).

						<p>FIFA is perfect as a Friday afternoon activity. Or as a start of the Tuesday. Basically, it doesn’t matter when you play and for what reason - recharging your brain or because you just feel like it, as long as you play! And don’t be afraid if your FIFA skills are a little less developed: being a master in Mario Card or Mortal Kombat is also fine. </p>

					<p>It is great if your love beans, because vegetables are healthy and we like healthy people (by the way, we also like unhealthy people). Loving coffee beans is even better! We have an awesome coffee machine with real coffee beans and everyone enjoys it throughout the day. </p>

						<p>Basically we bet about anything and for anything. Whether it is about you master a certain act, what is going to happen in the next episode of Temptation or who is going to win in the next FIFA-game. Everything is worth a bet! And what’s at stake is not always in the right ratio with what the bet is about. </p>
